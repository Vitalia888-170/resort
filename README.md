## Hotel "BEACH RESORT" :desert_island:
### Brief description
This is a rooms reservation website for fictional hotel "BEACH RESORT". You can find five different pages:home, rooms, single room, basket and error pages.
#### Power of react hooks
All functionalities are based on react hooks. Although, Redux as a state manager will be proper in this —Åase, but I set goal to myselft to write a BLL only using useReducer and useContext.
#### Data
There is data.js file, which contains local data of whole website. I know it's not the best approach, but I will improve it, and all data I need will be got from the server.
#### Credit card visualization
For creating cool UI of ordering I used "React-credit-card" and "Card-validator". It creates a synchronized functionality when you are entering your card value.
